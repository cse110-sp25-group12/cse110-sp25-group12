## Maintenance Instructions

Before you push to main, *stop* and think about what you are doing for a second. If you haven't
compiled the website locally via Jekyll, **DO NOT** push to remote. 

When you push something to remote, not only does it take a few minutes for it to reflect on the
published webpage but it is also a **horrible** dev practice.
