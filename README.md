Team 12 Homepage
This branch hosts the team webpage. DO NOT MERGE.

This website uses Just The Docs, a documentation theme for Jekyll.

Maintenance Instructions
Before you push to main, stop and think about what you are doing for a second. If you haven't compiled the website locally via Jekyll, DO NOT push to remote.

When you push something to remote, not only does it take a few minutes for it to reflect on the published webpage but it is also a horrible dev practice.
If you are making a change to the website, please do it in a separate branch and make a pull request. This way, we can review the changes before they go live.
