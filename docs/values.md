# Our Values
{: .no_toc}



Even if we have commitment issues with our code, we're all in when it comes to collaboration. Here's how we roll:
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

### 🧠 1. Learning Over Knowing  
We're here to grow, not show off. No question is too basic. No bug is too embarrassing. If we don't know something, we *ask*. If we do know it, we *share*.

> "There are no stupid questions — only mysterious errors we haven't solved yet."

---

### 🤝 2. Teamwork Over Heroics  
We don't do "lone wolves." If you're stuck, you speak up. If you're ahead, you help out. No one gets left behind in a Git merge war.

> "We don't need a 10x developer. We need 5x good vibes."

---

### 🐛 3. Debug the Problem, Not the Person  
Mistakes happen. Typos exist. Bugs will crawl into even the best code. We approach problems with empathy, not blame.

> "We commit code, not judgment."

---

### 🧹 4. Clean Code, Clean Conscience  
We strive to write readable, maintainable code — not just because it works, but because we're *nice people who care about the next dev (including future-us).*

> "If you can't read it in 2 weeks, it's a crime."

---

### 🎤 5. Everyone Has a Voice  
Your thoughts matter, whether you're suggesting a new feature, raising a concern, or just dropping a chaotic idea for a mascot. Respectful communication is our default.

> "Speak your mind — respectfully and with memes, if needed."

---

### 💻 6. Git Responsibly  
Yes, our name is "Git Commitment Issues" — but when it comes to version control, we play safe: branching, commenting, and committing like adults (most of the time).

> "We push with care, and we pull together."
